Main repository containing code for the engine.

# About
Underscore Engine is a new, easy to use and open source game engine written in C#. The engine comes with component handling, rendering, IO handling, its own physics and much more.

# Developers
This engine is developed and maintained by underscore.

# Contributing
Currently, contributions are not accepted. However, once the core engine is complete, we will allow developers to submit pull requests with new modules that add extra functionality to our engine.

# Future developments
Once the core functionality of the engine is complete, we are planining on implementing extra features such as shaders, sprite creation tools and a GUI for our engine. These are low priority, extension features that are purely conceptual at this stage.
