# Game Engine

Main repository containing source code the underscore engine. Main project was bootstrapped using [andrew-r-king's sfml boilerplate](https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate).

# About

Underscore Engine is a new, easy to use and open source game engine written in C++. The engine comes with component handling, rendering, IO handling, its own physics and much more.

# Developers

This engine is developed and maintained by underscore.

# Contributing

Currently, contributions are not accepted. However, once the core engine is complete, we will allow developers to submit pull requests with new modules that add extra functionality to our engine.

# Future developments

Once the core functionality of the engine is complete, we are planning on implementing extra features such as shaders, sprite creation tools and a GUI for our engine. These are low priority, extension features that are purely conceptual at this stage.
